# Articles Research Chatbot
This project is a research article search chatbot that allows users to input queries and retrieve relevant articles from the OpenAlex API, along with a summary generated by OpenAI GPT. The application consists of a React-based frontend and an Express-based backend, ensuring a seamless user experience.

## Project Structure
The project is divided into two main parts:
articlesresearch-react-app/ 
├── Dockerfile # Dockerfile for the frontend application 
├── docker-compose.yml # Docker Compose configuration to run both frontend and backend 
├── server/ # Backend code folder 
│ ├── index.js # Express API server code 
│ ├── .env # API keys (not included in the repository) 
│ ├── Dockerfile # Dockerfile for the backend application 
├── src/ # Frontend code folder 
│ ├── App.js # Main React application file 
│ ├── components/ # All React components 
│ │ ├── ChatBot.js # Main ChatBot component 
│ │ ├── MessageList.js # MessageList component for rendering messages 
│ │ ├── ChatInput.js # ChatInput component for user input 
│ │ └── TypingIndicator.js # Component to show typing status 
└── README.md # This documentation file

## How to Run the Application
You can run the project using Docker for both frontend and backend, or manually by starting the React app and the Express server separately.

### 1. Clone the Repository
To clone the project, use the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/articlesresearch-react-app.git
cd articlesresearch-react-app
```

### 2. Using Docker to Run the Application
Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed on your machine. Then, use the following command to build and run both the frontend and backend services:
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```
The frontend application will be accessible at http://localhost:3000.
The backend API will be running at http://localhost:5000.

### 3. Manually Running the Application
Running the Frontend (React)
Navigate to the root of the articlesresearch-react-app directory and run the following commands to install dependencies and start the frontend:
```bash
npm install
npm start
```
The React app will open automatically at http://localhost:3000.
Running the Backend (Express API)
Navigate to the server folder and run the following commands to install dependencies and start the backend server:
```bash
cd server
npm install
node index.js
```
The API will be running at http://localhost:5000.

#### Environment Variables
The backend requires an OpenAI API key to generate queries and summaries. This key should be stored in a .env file inside the server folder. The .env file should look like this:
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```
##### Project Features
Article Search: Users can input queries, and the chatbot will generate relevant OpenAlex API URLs using GPT, fetch results, and display them as article cards.
Summarization: After retrieving articles, the chatbot provides a summary based on the search results.
UI/UX: The frontend is built with React and Material UI, offering a clean and responsive user experience.
Error Handling: Both frontend and backend handle errors gracefully, providing appropriate feedback to users in case of network or API failures.

##### Key Design Decisions
Component-based Architecture: The frontend uses React functional components and hooks to manage state and handle the chat functionality. Components such as ChatInput, CreateLists, MessageBubble, and TypingIndicator are modular and reusable.

API Integration: The backend integrates with OpenAI and OpenAlex APIs. OpenAI generates the search URL and summaries, while OpenAlex provides the article data.

Docker Setup: Docker is used to ensure consistency across different environments, avoiding potential "works on my machine" issues.

###### Timeline
Reviewed Take-home Task requirements
Tested OpenAlex links using Postman
Initialized the React project and created a basic interface that returns data from input URLs
Added the step to call ChatGPT API, fine-tuned prompts to generate URLs
Developed backend code
Updated the UI to a conversational interface
Refined the card style for displaying returned data
Checked all components and added error handling
Built Docker containers
